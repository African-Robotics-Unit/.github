## About

The **African Robotics Unit** (ARU) is a research unit within the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.uct.ac.za/) at the [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za/). The ARU is a multidisciplinary research unit that focuses on the development of robotics and autonomous systems for application in the African context.

The objective of the ARU is to study robotic problems that we, as Africans, are uniquely positioned to solve.

## Research

Our main research areas are:

- **Bio-Inspired Robotics** - Development of biologically inspired robots with advanced motion capture and control systems technologies.
- **Autonomous Vehicles** - Development of mapping and navigational systems for autonomous vehicles using a variety of sensors and machine learning techniques.
- **Marine Robotics** - Development of scientific mechatronic systems for research and exploration, particularly in Antarctica and Southern Ocean, in collaboration with the [UCT MARiS](https://maris.uct.ac.za) interdisciplinary centre.
