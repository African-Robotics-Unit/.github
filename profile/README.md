Welcome to the UCT ARU GitHub Organisation. This organisation is used to host code and other assets developed by the ARU.

## About

The **African Robotics Unit** (ARU) is a research unit within the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.uct.ac.za/) at the [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za/). The ARU is a multidisciplinary research unit that focuses on the development of robotics and autonomous systems for application in the African context.

The objective of the ARU is to study robotic problems that we, as Africans, are uniquely positioned to solve.

## Research

Our main research areas are:

- **Bio-Inspired Robotics** \
  Biologically inspired robots with advanced motion capture and control systems technologies.
- **Autonomous Vehicles** \
  Mapping and navigational systems for autonomous vehicles using a variety of sensors and machine learning techniques.
- **Marine Robotics** \
  Scientific mechatronic systems for research and exploration, particularly in Antarctica and Southern Ocean, in strong collaboration with the [UCT MARiS](https://maris.uct.ac.za) interdisciplinary centre.
